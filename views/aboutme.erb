  <h2>Hi. I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.</h2>
  <p>A developer-in-training, I'm currently a student in
    <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="blank">Ada Developers
      Academy's</a> Cohort[1].
      Before that I was a multimedia producer at
      <a href="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a> where I learned countless animal factoids
      while working on my primary property <em>Nature</em>.
      I break those out regularly at dinner parties.
      I like doing things on computers.
      I also like doing a lot of <a href="/favoritethings">other things</a>.
