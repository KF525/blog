    <h2>Hi. I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.</h2>
    <p>A developer-in-training, I'm currently a student in
      <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="blank">Ada Developers
        Academy's</a> Cohort[1]. Before that I was a multimedia producer at
        <a href="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a>. I like doing things on computers.
        I also like a lot of other things like crossword puzzles, bacon, and
        weird science.</p>
